			<h1>JavaScript is a programming language</h1>

			<p>C++ is also a programming language. It is not dynamically typed, which means it is <em>what</em>? In Computer Science, I know the answer to that! Surely it is <strong>$[PLACEHOLDER]</strong> typed. Heh. I'll see myself out. Anyway, let me Google that real quick (Stop saying "Google" all the time! Maybe one "Yandexes" it or "DuckDucks" it or something. It is just querying a search engine for proper answers). My guess is that it is statically typed, or <strong>hard</strong> typed. Heh.</p>
